# Sourcefier

Can't remember the format in which a source item needs to be. We've got you covered!

## Introduction

Input source link to output a source element for the end of your essay.

Sourcefier will scan the page HTTP headers, html head and meta tags and more to determine the required values for a valid source reference.

## NOTE: Not all sites contain all the required information, such as the author or the release date so remember to check the output source validity.
